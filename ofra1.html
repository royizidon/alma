            <h1>A New Drug for Improved Healing Following Pelvic Floor Reconstructive Surgery</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Background and Unmet Need</h2>
            <p>Millions of women worldwide suffer from pelvic floor disorders (PFDs), including pelvic organ prolapse (POP), urinary incontinence, and sexual dysfunction. POP impairs quality of life and is associated with depression. The prevalence of POP is expected to increase, highlighting a significant public health concern. Current treatments often lead to ineffective healing, making the development of a new drug crucial for enhancing post-surgery healing.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Solution</h2>
            <p>Dr. Ofra Zidon's discovery of Arginase 1 as a mediator of delayed healing has led to the development of a small molecule inducer, SM1, showing promising results in tissue repair. Together with Prof. Shlomo Magadassi, they have improved SM1's solubility, paving the way for future vaginal gel/ointment/suppositories formulations.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <h3>Future Objectives</h3>
                <p>With improved solubility, the next step is developing a user-friendly vaginal application to promote healing and tissue regeneration effectively.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Market Potential</h2>
            <p>The market for Pelvic Organ Prolapse Repair is projected to reach 1 USD billion by 2036. POP affects over 35% of the female population, driving demand for effective treatments. Dr. Zidon's research and new drug formulations are poised to make a significant impact in this growing market.</p>
