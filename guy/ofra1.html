        <h1>Hanan's Memorial Foundation</h1>
        <p>Hanan was born to Ron and Tali. Second of four sons. Hanan was a curious boy blessed with talents. His curiosity led him to study biotechnology at Hadassah College.</p>
        <p>Towards the end of his bachelor's degree, he was supposed to start practical research work under the guidance of Dr. Ofra Zidon. However, the war altered his plans. Immediately after October 7th, Hanan was called to serve in the reserves. During the fighting in Gaza, he was seriously injured and subsequently got infected by a fungus that proved fatal after a struggle of several weeks.</p>
        <p>To honor Hananâ€™s memory, his family and friends are establishing a foundation dedicated to biomedical research.</p>
        <p>With your generous donation, we can continue Hanan's vision and support advancements in translational clinical research.</p>
        <p class="important">**</p>
        <p>Research will be conducted at the Women's Health Lab at Shaare Zedek Medical Center.</p>
